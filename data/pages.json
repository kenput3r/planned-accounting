This software makes it possible for individuals with little to no accounting experience to file their own tax returns.</p><p>A CPA vs TurboTax is an improper comparison. The proper comparison is, is it better to file your taxes yourself, or to have a professional accountant with experience with tax law compliance prepare and file your tax returns for you? We have found that it is almost always better to have an experienced tax professional file on your behalf. TurboTax is great, in fact it is so great that many accountants use it to file tax returns, but they do so with the knowledge of the limitations and boundaries of the law, ensuring that you are taking advantage of every opportunity and maximizing your deductions.</p>"
