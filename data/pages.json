The proper comparison is, is it better to file your taxes yourself, or to have a professional accountant with experience with tax law compliance prepare and file your tax returns for you? We have found that it is almost always better to have an experienced tax professional file on your behalf. TurboTax is great, in fact it is so great that many accountants use it to file tax returns, but they do so with the knowledge of the limitations and boundaries of the law, ensuring that you are taking advantage of every opportunity and maximizing your deductions.</p>"

Deductions are subtracted from gross income, effectively lowering how much tax is owed. Types of deductions and their limits vary by circumstances, including but not limited to profession, entity type, total gross income, and household size. Understanding these different circumstances, how they play a role in deduction availability and applying them is one of the primary roles that a CPA plays in preparing and filing income tax returns.</p>"
